    <h1>Isaac Newton</h1>
    <p>Isaac Newton was born December 25, 1642 January 4, lived in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England, he died March 20, 
        1727 in London. <b>he was an English physicist and mathematician who was the culminating figure of the Scientific 
        Revolution of the 17th century</b>. In optics, his discovery of the composition of white light integrated the phenomena of 
        colours into the science of light and laid the foundation for modern physical optics. <strong>In mechanics, his three laws of 
        motion, the basic principles of modern physics, resulted in the formulation of the law of universal gravitation</strong>. In 
        mathematics, he was the original discoverer of the infinitesimal calculus. Newtonâ€™s Philosophiae Naturalis Principia 
        Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, 1687) was one of the most important single works in the 
        history of modern science.
